# GAN-Fashion-MNIST
Project to build a GAN for images in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. 

We built a simple GAN using only Dense layers (along with dropout and batchnormalization) for both the generator and the discriminator, and trained it on the Fashion-MNIST dataset for 50 epochs. Following is small sample of images produced by the GAN:
